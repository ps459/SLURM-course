Alistair Kitching in the UIS User Administration team has setup the following accounts for your course delivery on the MCS.

  Stuart Rankin - sjr20@cam.ac.uk
  z400 - z449
 initial password: buzz4rd

This is a standard set of Ids that can be used in all our teaching rooms

Instructor: Z400 hpc100!

We advise course givers to reset their instructor account (z400) before the first course and request to reset the passwords for the course participants at least once at the end of the term. This is based on the assumption that passwords haven't been divulged to course participants.

You can change the instructor MCS password when you are logged in to the MCS with that account. WRONG 

For any (all) password queries e.g. resetting passwords for your course id range please contact 

* Alistair (ak118) or Guy Goodrick (gdg23)

Robert King from Desktop Services has set your accounts with relevant permissions to:

1. Access the Course ID Manager tool
2. Access UX\Lessons

During the induction session I will take you through items relating to the above.

Should you have any issues with software on the MCS or permissions please direct it to service-desk@ucs.cam.ac.uk and it will be forwarded to the correct person.

Additionally I have cced our operations team with the account details as they will be able to remotely log you in to MCS Windows. The team comprises of :

* Mark Barringer (Operations Manager)
* Paul Hunt-Deol
* Simon Meaker
* Terry Sheehan

Title: An Introduction to High Performance Computing and the HPCS

Description: The course aims to give an introductory overview of High Performance Computing (HPC) in
general, and of the facilities of the High Performance Computing Service (HPCS) in particular.
Practical examples of using the HPCS clusters will be used throughout, although it is hoped that
much of the content will have applicability to systems elsewhere. The focus will be on novice use of
HPC but familiarity with the UNIX command line and environment is essential (please first attend the
course Unix: Introduction to the Command Line Interface
[http://www.training.cam.ac.uk/ucs/event/1224910]).

Target Audience: Novice users of HPC; anyone who expects to need to use HPC systems at some stage in
their research. Basic familiarity with the UNIX command line is required; simple shell scripting
experience is desirable, however, programming expertise is not required (the focus will be on how to
run, rather than on what to run).

Durations:  one full day split into two sessions (09:00 - 12:30 and 13:30 - 16:00)

Trainer(s)/Lecturers: Stuart Rankin (High Performance Computing Service, UIS)

Start time: 09:00

End Time: 16:00

Format: Presentations and practical examples

Topics covered:
Basic concepts:
 - serial, parallel and high throughput workload
 - a quick look at the modern computer
        (vector/multithread/multicore/multisocket CPUs; nonuniform memory)

	 SISD, SIMD, MIMD
	 superscalar - instruction-level parallelism; -> SMT, thread-level parallelism on superscalar core

 - interconnecting nodes (ethernet, Infiniband, proprietary)
 - how to put it together (shared memory, distributed memory, ccNUMA, single system image)
 - coprocessors (GPUs and similar things)
 - cluster storage
 - job scheduling

 - Darwin - an example of an infiniband CPU cluster
 - Wilkes - an example of a dual-rail infiniband GPU cluster
 - Service Levels (free and non-free usage)
 - Help and further information

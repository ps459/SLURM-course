Basic concepts:
 - serial, parallel and high throughput workload
 - a quick look at the modern computer
        (vector/multithread/multicore/multisocket CPUs; nonuniform memory)

 - how to put it together (shared memory, distributed memory, ccNUMA, single system image)
 - coprocessors (GPUs and similar things)
 - cluster storage
 - job scheduling
